        A project where the topic changes every month, giving myself a goal and seeing how far I can take it within the given time.

      </h3>
      <p>
        A complete run through of Undertale + Pacifist Ending fully voiced out, this was my first time doing voice acting and directing and was a lot of fun learning the process. I did this project so my mother can experience this game without having the skills or time to play it.

        <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/amalgamnation">AmalgamNation</a>
      </h3>
      <p>
        A shared Twitch account between my friends and I to try out live streaming. Given our adult lives and responsibilities we don't have the capacity to run a growing channel on our own so we came together to collaborate and share the effort, learning new skills and technology, trying out new ideas and projects. I personally stream design related content and a competitive indie game tournament.
